An online companion app for the classic board game HeroQuest! Allows for character tracking and a space for playing the board game online.

Have you ever lost your Hero Quest character sheets? Do you want to play HeroQuest online with your friends? Jump in and join the fun but beware of the monsters lurking in the dungons!!!!

## For Employers
There is a copy of our final presentation in the public folder `app/client/public/Final Presentation`.

# Setup

Tech Stack - Frontend: React, React Router, Material UI, Typescript
Backend: Rails, PSQL

You need **TWO** terminals.

In one terminal, run `bundle` to install the dependencies. Run `bin/rake db:setup` to create the databases (called rails_project_development by default). Run `bin/rails s` to run the server.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `client`. Run `npm install`. Then run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

The main important part is that the React project has `proxy` set to `localhost:3001` in the `package.json` file.
